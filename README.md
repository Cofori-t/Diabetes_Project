# Project description
# Introduction

Diabetes is a disease that occurs when the blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high.

According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) data, 537 million people live with Diabetes, which may increase to 643 million by 2030 and to 783 million by 2045.

As my project work, I have created a model that could be used to predict the likelihood of Diabetes in patients based on their Medical history and Demographic details.:

Dependent Var: 
Gender, Age, Hypertension(Blood-Pressure), Heart Disease, Body Mass Index (BMI), Smoking history, HbA1c level, and Blood Glucose Level

Target Var: 
Diabetes. (Binary outcome)

Machine Learning Algorithm using Logistic Regression Model.

#Conclusion

This model only detect, if there is a likelihood of being diabetic OR Not. 
             
There are different of Types of Diabetes namely:
             
TYPES: 1, 2, Pre-diabates, Gestational Diabetes.
             
For further diagnosis, PLEASE consult your physician, who will:
             
1. confirm on the Type, 
             
2. give the needed Care Advice.
